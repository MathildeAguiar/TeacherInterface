# TeacherInterface

This repository is the result of my 4th year's internship at LORIA. 
During this internship I was in charge of developing the “teacher side” of the Web application. To do so, I used a light framework called Flask. I also used some plugins like Flask WTForms and Bootstrap Flask. 
I also took care of the database redefinition and development, by using Flask SQLAlchemy and SQLite dialects.
